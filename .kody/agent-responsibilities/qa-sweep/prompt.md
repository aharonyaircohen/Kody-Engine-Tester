# QA Sweep

## Job

Periodic **broad exploratory QA** of the whole app — no scenario, no scope.
Delegates to the `qa-engineer` agentAction with **no `--scope`**, so it smoke-tests
every discovered route against the live deployment, then summarizes the result
to the inbox. This catches regressions and rough edges in already-shipped
features that the changelog-verification agentResponsibility (which only tests *new* entries)
never revisits.

This agentResponsibility is **live** (no `disabled:` key → enabled by default). The repo is
fully set up: `qa.fallbackUrl` in `kody.config.json` (`https://dev.aguy.co.il`)
resolves the target URL, the `LOGIN_USER` variable + `LOGIN_PASSWORD` secret
carry the QA credentials, and the `.kody/context/*.md` entries tagged for
`qa-engineer` carry the route list + flows, so `qa-engineer` can log in and
browse. To pause it, add `disabled: true` to the frontmatter.

**Cadence.** Set by the `every:` frontmatter (the dashboard schedule dropdown)
and enforced by the engine — the agentResponsibility won't tick more often than its interval.
A full sweep is the most expensive QA run, so the default is daily (`every: 1d`).

**One run in flight at a time.**

**Per tick (one action max):**

1. Check for an open sweep tracking issue:
   `gh issue list --label "kody:qa-sweep" --state open --json number,title,createdAt,comments`
2. **Open, created < 2h ago** → emit `cursor: awaiting-result` and exit (sweep
   in flight; don't double-trigger).
3. **Open, with a `qa-engineer` report present** → post one inbox rec
   summarizing the sweep (verdict + finding count, links to the findings),
   close the tracking issue, clear `data.openIssue`.
4. **Open, ≥ 2h old, no report** → comment the stall, close it, clear state
   (the next eligible tick re-runs). A stuck sweep must never wedge the job.
5. **Otherwise** (none open) → open a tracking issue and dispatch with no
   scope via **typed workflow_dispatch** — never a bot `@kody` comment
   (the webhook's bot-author guard silently drops those, which is exactly
   how this agentResponsibility used to stall for hours):
   ```
   gh issue create --title "QA sweep $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)" --label kody:qa-sweep \
     --body "Automated broad QA sweep; qa-engineer reports here."
   gh workflow run kody.yml -f agentAction=qa-engineer -f issue_number=<n>
   ```
   Set `data.openIssue = <n>` and `data.lastRunISO = now`.

## Inbox recommendation format

One comment, terse. It **MUST** `@`-mention the operator on the first line —
that mention is the only thing that routes it into the dashboard inbox:

```
{{mentions}} 🧹 **QA sweep** — `<action>`

<one or two sentences: routes covered, verdict, finding count>

<!-- kody-agentResponsibility: {{agentResponsibility}} -->
<!-- kody-cmd: @kody qa-goal --issue <tracking> --scope "sweep" -->

_Confirm or dismiss in the dashboard inbox. QA will not act on its own._
```

The `<!-- kody-agentResponsibility: {{agentResponsibility}} -->` line is **always required** (even on a clean
sweep, where the `kody-cmd:` line is omitted) — it keys trust to this agentResponsibility.
Copy it verbatim.

`<action>` is `fix` when the sweep opened findings, or `note` for a clean
sweep. **On findings**, the `kody-cmd` is
`@kody qa-goal --issue <tracking> --scope "sweep"` — qa-engineer already posted
the sweep report on the tracking issue; on approve, `qa-goal` promotes it into
a fix goal (one ticket per finding). **On a clean sweep, omit the `kody-cmd:`
line** — it's informational; the operator just dismisses. **Never emit
`@kody approve`** — the engine has no `approve` verb. QA never creates the goal
itself; it's gated behind your approval.

## Allowed Commands

- `gh issue list`, `gh issue create`, `gh issue view`, `gh issue comment`,
  `gh issue close`.
- `gh workflow run kody.yml` — typed cross-run dispatch for `qa-engineer`
  (never substitute `gh issue comment "@kody qa-engineer …"`; that path is
  bot-filtered and silently stalls).

## Restrictions

- **Advisory only.** Dispatching `qa-engineer` is read-only. Never merge,
  approve, fix, or label PRs yourself — surface, the operator confirms.
- **One sweep in flight**, and at most **one** issue action per tick.
- If `gh issue create --label kody:qa-sweep` fails because the label is missing,
  run `gh label create kody:qa-sweep --description "Kody: broad QA sweep"` and
  retry — the in-flight check depends on the label.
- All writes go through `gh` — never `git commit`/`git push`, never open a PR.

## State

- `cursor`: `idle` | `awaiting-result`.
- `data.lastRunISO`: ISO timestamp of the last tick that dispatched a sweep.
- `data.openIssue`: number of the current sweep tracking issue (or null).
- `data.nextEligibleISO`: always emit — `data.lastRunISO + 24h`. Surfaced as
  "next run" on the dashboard.
- `done`: always `false` — QA is evergreen.

## Emit your next state (required when the steps above mention state)
Output your next state as the LAST thing you write, as a fenced block labeled exactly `kody-job-next-state` containing JSON like `{"cursor":"<state>","data":{...},"done":false}`. Omit it only if nothing changed.
