# Docs Coverage — in-code / folder headers

## Job

Periodic **broad sweep for in-code documentation gaps** — important folders
with no header explaining their purpose, or modules missing the `@ai-summary`
header A-Guy already uses widely. This is the slow, broad half of doc
maintenance (the per-PR README half is [`docs-readme.md`](./docs-readme.md)).
It catches the legibility gaps that no single PR triggers — folders that have
quietly grown without a "start here" note. It recommends the fix; it writes
nothing itself.

`disabled: true` until the coverage heuristic below is confirmed and the
dispatch verb is verified in the engine README. Flip to `disabled: false` once
both are checked.

**Cadence guard.** A full coverage sweep is broad and noisy if run too often.
If `data.lastRunISO` is set and within the last 24 hours, emit unchanged state
and exit. Otherwise proceed and set `data.lastRunISO` to now (UTC ISO).
(`every: 1d` is the cadence; the 24h guard is just a backstop against an extra
early wake.)

**One finding flagged per tick** — pick the single worst-covered folder, not a
batch. Doc-coverage debt is paid down one folder at a time so the inbox isn't
flooded.

**Per tick (one action max):**

1. Enumerate the layered source folders and their direct file count, e.g.:
   `for d in src/server/*/ src/lib/*/ src/ui/*/ src/client/*/ src/infra/*/; do echo "$d $(ls "$d"*.ts "$d"*.tsx 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"; done`
   (Skip `src/types/`, `src/utils/`, and generated dirs — too generic to
   usefully header at the folder level.)
2. For each folder, judge coverage with Read:
   - **Folder header present?** Read the folder's most-central file (the one
     matching the folder name, `index.ts`, or a `README.md` in the folder);
     does it carry an `@ai-summary` / purpose header? (A-Guy already uses
     `@ai-summary` extensively, so it's the established convention.)
   - **Module coverage:** roughly what fraction of the folder's `.ts`/`.tsx`
     files carry an `@ai-summary` header.
   A folder is **under-documented** if it has ≥ 4 source files and either no
   central header/README or < ~half its modules carry a summary.
3. Pick the **single worst** under-documented folder not already tracked
   (`gh issue list --label kody:docs-coverage --state open --json number,title --limit 50`;
   dedup key is the folder path in the title). If none qualify, idle.
4. Open a tracking issue (create the label first if missing —
   `gh label create kody:docs-coverage --description "Kody: in-code doc coverage gap"` —
   never skip the label) and post one inbox rec (format below).

### Issue body template

```
This folder is a load-bearing source area with little in-code documentation,
so a coding agent reading it cold has to infer purpose by grepping across
files.

- **Folder:** `<folder>`
- **Source files:** <count>
- **Central header / README (`@ai-summary` on the index/main file):** present | missing
- **Modules carrying `@ai-summary`:** <n>/<count>

On approval, the writer should add a concise folder-level header (what this
folder is, the entry point, and any load-bearing gotcha) and `@ai-summary`
headers to the modules that lack one — capturing the *why* and the *trap*,
never restating what the code says. Open a PR with the additions.
```

## Inbox recommendation format

One comment, terse. It **MUST** `@`-mention the operator on the first line —
that mention is the only thing that routes it into the dashboard inbox:

```
{{mentions}} 📂 **Doc-coverage gap** — `document`

`<folder>` (<count> files) has thin in-code docs — an agent reading it cold
must grep to learn its purpose. Approving dispatches a PR adding headers.

<!-- kody-cmd: @kody chore --issue <tracking> -->

_Confirm or dismiss in the dashboard inbox. The writer will not edit code on its own._
```

On approve, the Approve button posts the `kody-cmd` line verbatim, so it MUST
be one line, ≤ 300 chars, and name a real engine verb. **Verify `chore --issue`
in the engine README before enabling this capability** (per the agent's hard rule);
use whatever form the engine actually takes for "open a PR from this issue".
Never emit `@kody approve` — the engine has no `approve` verb.

## Allowed Commands

- Shell listing of `src/*/*/` for the file-count pass; Read tool to inspect
  file headers.
- `gh issue list`, `gh issue create`, `gh issue comment`, `gh label create`.

## Restrictions

- **Advisory only.** Never edit, commit, or push code; never open a PR; never
  merge/approve/label. You flag and recommend — the operator approves, the
  engine writes the headers.
- **One folder flagged per tick**, and at most **one** issue + one rec.
- **Daily** (`every: 1d`); the 24h `data.lastRunISO` guard is a backstop.
- **Dedup by tracking-issue title** (folder path); skip if an open one exists.
- Skip `src/types/`, `src/utils/`, and generated dirs — folder-level headers
  there aren't useful.
- All writes go through `gh` — never `git commit`/`git push`.

## State

- `cursor`: `idle` | `flagged`.
- `data.lastRunISO`: ISO timestamp of the last tick that flagged a folder.
- `data.nextEligibleISO`: always emit — `data.lastRunISO + 24h`. Surfaced as
  "next run" on the dashboard.
- `done`: always `false` — doc coverage is evergreen.

## Emit your next state (required when the steps above mention state)
Output your next state as the LAST thing you write, as a fenced block labeled exactly `kody-job-next-state` containing JSON like `{"cursor":"<state>","data":{...},"done":false}`. Omit it only if nothing changed.
