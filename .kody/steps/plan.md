You are a planning agent following the Superpowers Writing Plans methodology.

## MANDATORY: Pattern Discovery Before Planning

Before writing ANY plan, you MUST search for existing patterns in the codebase:

1. **Find similar implementations** — Grep/Glob for how the same problem is already solved elsewhere. E.g., if the task involves localization, search for how other collections handle localization. If adding auth, find existing auth patterns.
2. **Reuse existing patterns** — If the codebase already solves a similar problem, your plan MUST follow that pattern unless there's a strong reason not to (document the reason in Questions).
3. **Check decisions.md** — If `.kody/memory/decisions.md` exists, read it for prior architectural decisions that may apply.
4. **Never invent when you can reuse** — Proposing a new pattern when an existing one covers the use case is a planning failure.

After pattern discovery, examine the codebase to understand existing code structure, patterns, and conventions. Use Read, Glob, and Grep.

Output a markdown plan. Start with the steps, then optionally add a Questions section at the end.

## Step N: <short description>

**File:** <exact file path>
**Change:** <precisely what to do>
**Why:** <rationale>
**Verify:** <command to run to confirm this step works>

Superpowers Writing Plans rules:

1. TDD ordering — write tests BEFORE implementation
2. Each step completable in 2-5 minutes (bite-sized)
3. Exact file paths — not "the test file" but "src/utils/foo.test.ts"
4. Include COMPLETE code for new files (not snippets or pseudocode)
5. Include verification step for each task (e.g., "Run `pnpm test` to confirm")
6. Order for incremental building — each step builds on the previous
7. If modifying existing code, show the exact function/line to change
8. Keep it simple — avoid unnecessary abstractions (YAGNI)

Change sizing — keep each implementation step focused:

- ~100 lines changed → good. Reviewable in one pass.
- ~300 lines changed → acceptable if it's a single logical change.
- ~1000+ lines changed → too large. Split into multiple steps.
  If a plan step would exceed ~300 lines, break it into smaller steps.

If there are architecture decisions or technical tradeoffs that need input, add a Questions section at the END of your plan:

## Questions

- <question about architecture decision or tradeoff>

Questions rules:

- ONLY ask about significant architecture/technical decisions that affect the implementation
- Ask about: design pattern choice, database schema decisions, API contract changes, performance tradeoffs
- Recommend an approach with rationale — don't just ask open-ended questions
- Do NOT ask about requirements — those should be clear from task.json
- Do NOT ask about things you can determine from the codebase
- If no questions, omit the Questions section entirely — do NOT write "None" or "N/A" as a bullet point
- Maximum 3 questions — only decisions with real impact

Good questions: "Recommend middleware pattern vs wrapper — middleware is simpler but wrapper allows caching. Approve middleware?"
Bad questions: "What should I name the function?", "Should I add tests?"

## Pattern Discovery Report

After the plan steps and before Questions, include a brief report of what existing patterns you found and how your plan reuses them:

## Existing Patterns Found

- <pattern found>: <how it's reused in the plan>
- <if no existing patterns found, explain what you searched for>

# Architecture (auto-detected 2026-04-04)

## Overview

- Framework: Next.js 16.2.1
- Language: TypeScript 5.7.3
- Testing: vitest 4.0.18
- Linting: eslint ^9.16.0
- Formatting: prettier ^3.4.2
- CMS: Payload CMS 3.80.0
- Package manager: pnpm
- Module system: ESM
- Top-level directories: docs, scripts, skills, src, tests
- src/ structure: api, app, auth, collections, components, contexts, hooks, middleware, migrations, models, pages, routes, security, services, utils, validation

## Data Layer

- Database: PostgreSQL via `@payloadcms/db-postgres` (pool connection)
- ORM: Payload CMS collections with postgres adapter
- Payload auto-generates types to `src/payload-types.ts`
- Auto-generated REST API at `/api/<collection>` and GraphQL at `/api/graphql`

## API Layer

- `src/app/api/` — custom Next.js Route Handlers (enroll, gradebook, notes, notifications, quizzes, dashboard stats, health, search, csrf-token)
- `src/app/(payload)/api/` — Payload REST (`/[...slug]`) and GraphQL endpoints
- `src/api/auth/` — auth Route Handlers (login, logout, register, refresh, profile)
- GraphQL Playground at `/api/graphql-playground`

## Module/Layer Structure

- `src/collections/` → Payload collection configs (Users, Courses, Modules, Lessons, Enrollments, Certificates, Assignments, Submissions, Quizzes, QuizAttempts, Notifications, Notes, Media)
- `src/services/` → Business logic (gradebook, grading, progress, certificates, notifications, discussions, course-search, quiz-grader)
- `src/middleware/` → Express-style middleware (auth, role-guard, csrf, rate-limiter, request-logger, validation)
- `src/auth/` → JWT service, session store, user store, withAuth guard
- `src/components/` → React components grouped by domain (auth, board, command-palette, contacts, course-editor, dashboard, notes, notifications)
- `src/contexts/` → React contexts (auth-context)
- `src/hooks/` → Custom hooks (useCommandPalette, useCommandPaletteShortcut)
- `src/security/` → CSRF tokens, input sanitizers, validation middleware
- `src/migrations/` → Payload DB migrations
- `src/models/` → Data models (notification)
- `src/routes/` → Route definitions (notifications)
- `src/pages/` → Legacy Next.js pages (auth, board, contacts, error, notifications)
- `src/app/(frontend)/` → Next.js App Router frontend pages (dashboard, notes, instructor)
- `src/app/(payload)/` → Payload admin at `/admin` and Payload API routes

## Domain Model

├── Users (roles: admin, instructor, student)
├── Courses
│   ├── Modules
│   │   ├── Lessons
│   │   ├── Quizzes → QuizAttempts
│   │   └── Assignments → Submissions
│   ├── Enrollments

```

## Infrastructure

- Docker: `docker-compose.yml` with payload (Node 20) + postgres services
- CI: `pnpm ci` runs `payload migrate` then `pnpm build`
- Dev: `pnpm dev` with `.env` (DATABASE_URL, PAYLOAD_SECRET)

## conventions

**Naming**: Components/Types → PascalCase; functions/utils → camelCase; files → kebab-case (`.module.css`); collections → singular slug

**Imports**: Use `import type` for types; path alias `@/*` for internal modules; named imports preferred; Node.js built-ins use default imports (`import crypto from 'crypto'`)

```typescript
import type { Module } from '@/collections/Modules'
import type { Lesson, UpdateLessonInput } from '@/collections/Lessons'
import { LessonEditor } from './LessonEditor'
```

**Exports**: Named exports for utilities/types; default export for page components only; classes are named exports (`export class CertificatesStore`)

**Error Handling**: async/await with try-catch; `.catch(() => {})` for non-critical fallbacks (see `src/pages/auth/profile.tsx:27`)

**File Organization**: Single-responsibility utils in `src/utils/`; business logic in `src/services/`; Payload configs in `src/collections/`; React components in `src/components/`; security utilities in `src/security/`; auth logic in `src/auth/`; data models in `src/models/`; Express-style middleware in `src/middleware/`

**Style**: Prettier singleQuote, trailingComma=all, printWidth=100, semi=false; ESLint strict TypeScript; `'use client'` directive on all client components

**Module System**: ESM (`"module": "esnext"` in tsconfig)

## domain

**Core Entities:** `User` (roles: admin/editor/viewer/guest/student/instructor), `Media`, `Course`, `Lesson`, `Enrollment`, `Note`, `Quiz`, `QuizAttempt`, `Notification` (severity: info/warning/error, recipient, isRead)

**Data Flow:** Client → Next.js Route Handler (`src/app/api/*`) → `withAuth` HOC → Service Layer (`src/services/*`) → Payload Collections → PostgreSQL via `@payloadcms/db-postgres`

**API Surface:**

- `GET/POST /api/notes` — Note CRUD with search
- `GET /api/quizzes/[id]` — Quiz retrieval
- `POST /api/quizzes/[id]/submit` — Quiz grading via `QuizGrader`
- `GET /api/quizzes/[id]/attempts` — User's quiz attempts
- `GET /api/courses/search` — Course search with `CourseSearchService`
- `POST /api/enroll` — Enrollment (viewer role required)
- `GET /api/gradebook/course/[id]` — Grades per course (editor/admin)

**Auth Architecture:** JWT via `JwtService` (Web Crypto API), sessions in `SessionStore` (in-memory), `withAuth` HOC wraps routes, RBAC via `checkRole` utility

**Security:** Input sanitization via `sanitizeHtml` from `@/security/sanitizers`; CSRF tokens via `@/security/csrf-tokens`

**Migrations:** Users table extended with `lastLogin` (timestamp) and `permissions` (text[]) per `20260405_000000_add_users_permissions_lastLogin`

**Key Types:** `Config`, `User`, `Media`, `Note`, `Quiz`, `QuizAnswer`, `Notification`, `NotificationSeverity`, `PayloadGradebookService`, `CourseSearchService`, `Schema`, `SchemaError`

## patterns

### Additional Observations

- **Validation Schema-Driven Middleware** (`src/middleware/validation.ts`): Schema-based body/query/params validation with type coercion — a declarative validation Strategy.
- **Generic Dependency Interfaces** (`src/services/gradebook.ts`, `src/services/grading.ts`): Both services declare typed `Deps` interfaces (e.g., `GradebookServiceDeps<T...>`, `GradingServiceDeps<A,S,C>`) decoupling from Payload — enables testability and DI.
- **Rubric-Based Grading Model** (`src/services/grading.ts`): `RubricCriterion` + `RubricScore` types encode a structured scoring domain — an implicit Value Object pattern.
- **Password Hashing Divergence**: `AuthService` uses PBKDF2 (25000 iter, sha256) matching Payload's `generatePasswordSaltHash`; `UserStore` uses SHA-256 directly — confirmed anti-pattern.

## Stack

- **Integration**: Vitest 4.0 (`vitest.config.mts`, `environment: jsdom`, `setupFiles: ./vitest.setup.ts`) — `pnpm test:int`
- **E2E**: Playwright 1.58 (`playwright.config.ts`, chromium) — `pnpm test:e2e`
- **Runner**: `pnpm test` executes both suites sequentially

## Organization

| Type              | Location                                | Pattern                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Unit/Integration  | `src/**/*.test.ts`, `src/**/*.test.tsx` | Co-located with source                        |
| Integration Specs | `tests/int/**/*.int.spec.ts`            | Dedicated integration folder                  |
| E2E               | `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`                   | Page-object style helpers in `tests/helpers/` |

## Patterns

- **Mocks**: `vi.fn()` + `mockResolvedValue` / `mockRejectedValue` for Payload SDK stubs
- **Fixtures**: `seedTestUser()` / `cleanupTestUser()` pattern for E2E test data lifecycle
- **Fake Timers**: `vi.useFakeTimers()` / `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()` for async queue tests
- **Browser Context**: Shared `Page` instance via `browser.newContext()` in `beforeAll`
- **Helpers**: `tests/helpers/login.ts` encapsulates auth flow for E2E

## CI Quality Gates

- `pnpm ci` runs `payload migrate` → `pnpm build` → `pnpm test`
- Playwright `forbidOnly: true` prevents committed `.only()` tests
- Retries enabled on CI (2x) to reduce flaky failure noise
- `kody-watch.yml` runs scheduled E2E via `pnpm dev` on `localhost:3000`

## Coverage

- No explicit threshold configured; vitest run passes `--coverage` implicitly
- Example coverage: `CourseSearchService` tested via mocked Payload find calls

## Repo Patterns

- **Service Layer with Typed Deps** (`src/services/gradebook.ts`, `src/services/grading.ts`): Business logic services declare typed `Deps` interfaces (e.g., `GradebookServiceDeps<T...>`, `GradingServiceDeps<A,S,C>`) — reuse this pattern for new services to enable DI and testability.
- **Validation Middleware** (`src/middleware/validation.ts`): Schema-based body/query/params validation with type coercion using Zod — new API routes should use `validateRequest(schema)` middleware.
- **JWT + Session Auth** (`src/auth/JwtService.ts`, `src/auth/SessionStore.ts`): JWT via Web Crypto API with in-memory sessions, `withAuth` HOC for route protection, `checkRole` for RBAC — auth tasks must follow this pattern.
- **Payload Collections** (`src/collections/*.ts`): All data models as Payload configs — new collections go in `src/collections/` with singular slug naming.
- **Express-Style Middleware** (`src/middleware/*.ts`): Auth, role-guard, csrf, rate-limiter, request-logger chain — new middleware follows this pattern.
- **Sanitized Input** (`src/security/sanitizers.ts`): `sanitizeHtml` for XSS prevention — user-generated content must be sanitized before storage.

## Improvement Areas

- **Password Hashing Inconsistency** (`src/auth/UserStore.ts:20` vs `src/auth/AuthService.ts`): `UserStore` uses SHA-256 directly; `AuthService` uses PBKDF2 (25000 iter). New auth code must use AuthService pattern — do not add to UserStore.
- **Role Enum Mismatch**: `UserStore.UserRole` (`'admin'|'user'|'guest'|'student'|'instructor'`) vs `RbacRole` (`'admin'|'editor'|'viewer'`) — role-based tasks must align both enums.
- **Type Safety Fragility** (`src/app/(frontend)/dashboard/page.tsx`): Uses `as unknown as` casts — avoid this pattern; use proper type guards instead.
- **N+1 Query Risk**: Dashboard page batches lesson fetches, but other pages (e.g., `src/app/(frontend)/instructor/`) may miss similar optimizations.
