- Linting: eslint ^9.16.0
- Formatting: prettier ^3.4.2
- CMS: Payload CMS 3.80.0
- Database: PostgreSQL via @payloadcms/db-postgres
- Package manager: pnpm
- Module system: ESM
- Top-level directories: docs, scripts, skills, src, tests
- src/ structure: api, app, auth, collections, components, contexts, hooks, middleware, migrations, models, pages, routes, security, services, utils, validation

## Module/Layer Structure

**Data Flow**: API routes → Services → Payload Collections → PostgreSQL

- **src/app/api/**: REST endpoints organized by domain (auth, courses, gradebook, notifications, quizzes, notes)
- **src/auth/**: JWT service, session-store, user-store, withAuth wrapper, role guard
- **src/services/**: Business logic (gradebook, certificates, progress, notifications, discussions, quiz-grader, course-search)
- **src/collections/**: Payload CMS collection configs (Users, Media, Courses, Modules, Lessons, Enrollments, Certificates, Assignments, Submissions, Quizzes, QuizAttempts, Notifications, Notes)
- **src/middleware/**: Express-style middleware (auth, rate-limiter, role-guard, csrf, request-logger, validation)
- **src/security/**: Security utilities (csrf-token, sanitizers, validation-middleware)
- **src/migrations/**: Payload DB migrations (2 migrations applied)
- **src/hooks/**: React hooks (useCommandPalette, useCommandPaletteShortcut)

## Payload Collections

Users, Media, Courses, Modules, Lessons, Enrollments, Certificates, Assignments, Submissions, Quizzes, QuizAttempts, Notifications, Notes

## Infrastructure

- **Docker**: docker-compose.yml with payload + postgres services
- **CI**: GitHub Actions — `payload migrate` + `pnpm build` on merge
- **Dev**: `pnpm dev` (Next.js dev), `pnpm payload` (Payload CLI)
- **Tests**: `pnpm test:int` (vitest), `pnpm test:e2e` (playwright), `pnpm test` (both)
